# CIS250_Create14_Integrating Databases
For this assignment you will be working through a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to implement database functionality into a program. The notebook contains python script that provides limited interaction with the guitar store database for users.

## If Something Goes Wrong
There are no new installations this week, but if you encounter any issues with your tools please reach out to your instructor.

## Before Starting
1. If you have not already, please install [VS Code here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). ADS has limited support for the tools we will be using.
2. After installing VS Code, install the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to add notebook support.
3. Also install the [Python Extionsion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for VS Code
4. Clone your repository into VS Code just like we do ADS, and you should be able to open the notebook file and view the assignment.
5. Pay close attention to the installation instructions at the beginning of this notebook. You will need to use pip to install a new python module.

## Assignment Description

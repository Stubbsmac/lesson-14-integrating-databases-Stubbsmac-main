This notebook will demonstrate how you can connect to a SQL Server database using a programming language, and integrate that data into your program. For this demo we will be using Python since it is compatible with Jupyter Notebooks and is somewhat easy to read. You will not be expected to write ANY python for this assignment, you may have to mimic a process, but at most you will be copy/pasting and updating query scripts.\n",
